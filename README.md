#NEATSnake (Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Toplogies) - IN PROGRESS
An implementation of a reduced Snake Game with a NEAT Algorithm as the AI. The implementation of the NEAT Algorithm is based on the one described in depth in AI Techniques for Game Programming and the paper "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies" by Kenneth Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen. The aim is to have a neural net that can optimise its own structure to solve the problem of trying to find some target - in this case the head of a snake trying to find some target. This version of snake is functionally just a head - it has no ability to grow. A future aim for this would be to a) finish this project, and b) add in multiple nets trying to compete for some resource and observe the results.
